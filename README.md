This project is a small game in which you have to guess the name of TV series. It has two game modes and the possibility of creating and loading your user to save/load your progress and be able to appear in the user ranking.
The project is made with Vue js 2.x, Vue cli 3 for the initial setup, Vuetify for the visual part and UI, Axios for API requests, and Firebase for user management and ranking.
The series data is from the Episodate API API: https://www.episodate.com/api
